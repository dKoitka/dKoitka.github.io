Lanterns Update v0.2.0
In this fortnightly update:
{

[b]Coloured Coins[/b]
Like regular coins - except these coins require a light type to be visible and collected. They function the same as normal blocks that go from invisible to visible when the correct light type is shone on it. There's a constant sparkle on each of the coloured coins - so their location is visible.
