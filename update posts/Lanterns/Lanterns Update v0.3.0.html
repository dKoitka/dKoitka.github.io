<br>Lanterns Update v0.3.0
<br>In this fortnightly update:
<br>{
<br>
<br><b>Coloured Doors</b>
<br>Like the regular door - except these individual doors only allow the same coloured player to activate it. Rather than needing both <b>Red & Blue</b> - The door frame colour determines which colour it needs.
<br>
<br><b>Turrets</b>
<br>We've added turrets that shoot projectiles at constant intervals. There are normal (always visible), red, blue and purple turret variations.
<br>
<br><b>Blocks</b>
<br><ul>
<t><li><i>New </i> - Morphing Blocks.</li>
<t><li><i>New </i> - Sensor Blocks.</li>
<t><li><i>New </i> - Spiked Sensor Blocks.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br><b>Block, Turret & Door Art</b>
<br><ul>
<t><li><i>New</i> - Door Frame (Red & Blue).</li>
<t><li><i>New</i> - Turret Art.</li>
<t><li><i>New</i> - Turret Projectile Art.</li>
<t><li><i>New</i> - Morph Block Art.</li>
<t><li><i>New</i> - Sensor Block Art.</li>
<t><li><i>New</i> - Spiked Sensor Block Art.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br><b>25 New Levels!</b>
<br>New levels that showcase coloured doors, turrets, morph blocks, sensor blocks and the new block & spike types.
<br>More levels select doors within Level Select Master and it's subsequent doors that link to levels. If you can complete the last two levels, let us know, They're a bit experimental!
<br>
<br><b>Extra Bits and Bobs</b>
<br><ul>
<t><li>Updated checkpoint VFX and SFX - to make them a little more obvious when activated.</li>
<t><li>Fixed some blocks that were displaying the incorrect sprites when in certain states of activation.</li>
<t><li>Merged all of the player related sounds into the SFX grouping. Removed player audio grouping from UI > Audio Panel.</li>
</ul>
<br>
