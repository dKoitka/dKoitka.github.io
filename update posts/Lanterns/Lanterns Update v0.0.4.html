<br>In this fortnightly update:
<br>{
<br><b>Respawn Overhaul - Checkpoint Respawning System</b>
<br>We’ve changed how respawning works. It no longer respawns your character on the last safe normal block they were standing on. They now respawn at a set location - Candle Stands. Only a single checkpoint (for each player) can be set as the active respawn location. A previously activated checkpoint cannot be re-activated. We’re working on visualisations that make this clear.
<br>
<br><b>Extra Bits and Bobs</b>
<br>Added Bug Report Button in the pause menu.
<br>Added “Level Text” - in the pause menu - that shows which level is currently being played. Hopefully if you encounter any issues, or have suggestions, this will help identify which content you can direct your feedback to.
<br>Added Individual UI Player Death count - in the pause menu.
<br>Added Build Version Number - in the pause menu.
<br>Added Colour Blind Button - in the pause menu. This will toggle colour representative icons on appropriate coloured game content. This functionality will be coming soon.
<br>}
<br>
<br><b>Need a Friend?</b>
<br>Because Lanterns is currently only local-coop, and sometimes you're in need of a friend but don't have one at the ready. You could try using <a href="https://parsecgaming.com/"> Parsec	</a>.
<br>
<br><b>Discord</b>
<br>Come join us in <a href="https://discord.gg/VaYx8Px"> Discord</a>.
