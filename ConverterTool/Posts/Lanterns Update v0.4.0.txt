[h1]What's To Come?[/h1]
[b]Character Update[/b]
We have some major design changes in the works that will add a lot of variety to game play - in the form of new playable characters and character specific mechanics.
Anthropomorphised Playable Character Sets:
Foxes
Owls (Currently represented as the skull character set)
Moths
Angler Fish
[b]Please note this is not final and has the potential to change.[/b]

[h1]Level Progression[/h1]
Currently - lanterns has about 75 playable levels worth of content. It has a very linear progression - and as the game goes on, new mechanics are implemented and slapped on the end of the existing content. It hasn't been tailored in any way. We're getting to the stage in development now where we're going to start refining this progression, especially now the content updates will be related to new character sets. The current levels within the game won't just disappear - they'll remain safe for a long while, if not forever as some of the original content. Although we'll be drawing inspiration for the new content and progression based off our findings and experiences with these levels.

[h1]One Last Mechanic[/h1]
In the recent changes you will notice content updates that include many new mechanics and ways that lanterns light effect and interact with blocks and other objects within the world. There's one more to go - that isn't in this update but will be in one, in the near future. We've prototyped all of the mechanics we set out to, that we felt fit with the game nicely. There were also a few that didn't make the cut. We haven't forgotten about them and they're definitely stored for later on down the track just in case.
