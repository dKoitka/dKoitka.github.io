In this fortnightly update:
{
[b]Colour Blind Accessibility - Colour Icons[/b]
We've implemented colour icons on blocks and spikes.

[b]Reorganised Pause Menu[/b]
In the pause menu there's a new button "Options". This activates a sub-panel that houses options for:
[list]
[*]Toggling colour blind icons.
[*]Controlling audio levels.
[*]Bug Reporting. [b]Note: this opens an external link.[/b]
[*]Credits. 
[/list]

[b]Extra Bits and Bobs[/b]
[list]
[*]Iterated on some level design.
[/list]
}

[b]Need a Friend?[/b]
