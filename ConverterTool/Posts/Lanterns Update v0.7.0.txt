[h1]Character Set Collectables[/h1]
Each character set now has Character Set Collectables (CSC). These collectables count towards unlocking a new character set. Character Select portals in the character select level now show the amount of CSC's required to unlock the next character set. Portals in level selects show which levels contain a CSC.
[list]
[*][i]New[/i] - Character Set Collectable Sprites & Animations.
[*][i]New[/i] - Character Set Collectable Particles.
[*][i]New[/i] - Character Set Collectable Trails.
[*][i]New[/i] - Character Set Collectable UI Feedback.
[*][i]Updated[/i] - Character Select Portals include CSC progress.
[*][i]Updated[/i] - Level Select Portals to include CSC progress.
[/list]All character sets are still currently unlocked and playable - but collecting them will still accumulate progress - for when progression is refined and complete.

[h1]What's To Come?[/h1]
[b]Known Issues[/b]
[list]
[*]Missing Playstation 4 Controller support - We're in the process of updating controller support entirely which will result in many more controllers being compatible with the game.
[*]The last level of Axolotl character set has issues with standing on the sideways sensor blocks.
[*]Full screen/Windowed mode toggling/Cursor issues.
[*]Coloured degrading blocks are lacking the visual of dissolving.
[*]Finishing the last level in a character set doesn't revert to the Character Select level - instead continues to the first level of the next character set.
[/list]

[b]Level Editor[/b]
This will be a lengthy process - but we hope to keep everyone informed on the progress being made.

[b]Levels[/b]
Refined level progression and level sets for all characters. We'll also be in the process of removing all of the current level set and replacing them with more permanent levels. Theres a good chance that a lot of the current levels in v0.7.0 will start to be shifted into an archive location or completely removed.
